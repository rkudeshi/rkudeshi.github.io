The beauty of the web, unlike printed media, is how it facilitates wonderfully fast communication. If you have something to say, I would love to hear it.

I welcome all comments, constructive or critical. But dare I say I prefer the latter? While praise is a welcome occurrence, criticism is more important. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you disagree with something I’ve written, find a typo, or any other reason.

I am available via email at ![contact-mail](/silo/images/contact-mail.png)

I can also be found on Twitter as [@rkudeshi](http://twitter.com/rkudeshi).

I only check my inbox at scheduled intervals, so it may take some time to respond. Thank you for your patience.
