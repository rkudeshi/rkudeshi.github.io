<p>The beauty of the web, unlike printed media, is how it facilitates wonderfully fast communication. If you have something to say, I would love to hear it.</p>
<p>I welcome all comments, constructive or critical. But dare I say I prefer the latter? While praise is a welcome occurrence, criticism is more important. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you disagree with something I’ve written, find a typo, or any other reason.</p>
<p>I am available via email at <img id="contact-mail" title="" alt="contact-mail" src="../files/images/contact-mail.png" /></p>
<p>I can also be found on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/rkudeshi">@rkudeshi</a>.</p>
<p>I only check my inbox at scheduled intervals, so it may take some time to respond. Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>— Ravi</p>
