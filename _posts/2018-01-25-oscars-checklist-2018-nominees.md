title: "Oscars checklist 2018, take three: all 59 nominated movies, grouped by highest category"
---

For anyone else attempting the Oscars Death Race (watching every movie nominated in every category!), I've again made a list of all movies and grouped them by their highest category. This way, it's a little easier to see which "major" movies you have yet to watch and which other movies you still need to see.[^oscar-nominees-watched-2018]

[^oscar-nominees-watched-2018]: Of the 34 feature-length English films nominated (AKA everything but the docs/shorts/foreign categories), I've managed to watch all but 3 so far: **Mudbound** (a Netflix original, but I'm hoping they re-release it in theaters now), **The Breadwinner** (foreign animated movie that I apparently missed in November), and...**The Boss Baby** (*really?!*).

### By the numbers

There are 24 Oscar categories, with 5 nominees in almost every category (Best Picture has 9 nominees again this year, Makeup & Hairstyling has only 3 nominees per usual).

That means 122 total nominations. Altogether, there are 44 feature-length films and 15 short films nominated (3 fewer than last year!).

If you group everything by their highest-nominated category, you're looking at...

* 19 "major" category nominees
* 15 "minor" category nominees
* 10 technical category nominees
* 15 short category nominees

So if you want to watch...

* All the Best Picture nominees: 9 movies.
* All the BP + major nominees: 19 movies.
* All the BP + major + minor nominees: 34 movies.
* All the BP + major + minor + technical nominees (AKA no shorts): 44 movies.

And if you wanted to watch *everything*...59 movies!
