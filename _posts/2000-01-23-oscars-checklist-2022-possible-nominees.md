title: "Oscars checklist 2022: The possible nominees"
---

As you may know from some of my past posts, I'm a bit a of a movie enthusiast. So much so that I enjoy trying to complete the [Oscars Death Race](https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2011/02/24/134029466/one-woman-56-movies-the-oscars-death-race-a-windmill-worth-tilting-at) each year - watching every movie nominated in every category at the Oscars before the big ceremony. I try to take it one step further and watch them all in theaters, if possible.[^1]

To help me with this, I make a list early each year of the movies most likely to be nominated to help ensure I can watch them before they leave theaters. It's not always perfect, but it helps me get a big headstart.[^2]

Using data from GoldDerby, it looks like there are about 78 feature films that have a chance of being nominated this year!

[^1]: Of course, I only ventured into theaters over the past year after being fully vaccinated, wearing a mask every time, and going during off-peak times.

[^2]: I didn't make a list like this last year because theaters were closed entirely due to COVID-19. Every movie was able to watch at home via streaming or purchase, but I just didn't feel compelled to watch many of them throughout 2020. But then, with about a week before the Oscars ceremony, I got the bug and decided to try to catch up. I remember having to watch a ridiculous number of movies in a very short time span (including 18 movies over the final 3 days!), but I somehow did manage to complete the Oscars Death Race for one more year. Streak intact!

### The big list

To make this list, I downloaded GoldDerby's list of movies with a chance of being nominated in any category, removed all duplicates and short films, and sorted it by highest category. I also included the "points" total for each movie, which tells you how strong of a contender it is across all categories. For more explanation of the math behind that, check the next section with a snapshot of the movies and odds in all 23 categories listed below.

Of the 56 I've seen: I saw 53 in theaters and 3 at home.[^3]

Of the 22 I haven't seen: 4 have not been released yet[^4], 2 had a very limited theatrical release but I missed them[^5], 5 are now on my watchlist, and 11 are in minor categories that I don't prioritize right now (Best Documentary or Best Song).

[^3]: I only saw **Luca**, **Raya and the Last Dragon**, and **Coming 2 America** at home because they never got a theatrical release at all. The first two were fantastic and I so wish I could've seen them on the big screen for the first time. I've been holding out on watching **The Mitchells vs The Machines** for the same reason - it supposedly had a brief theatrical release at limited "nationwide" theaters in November to increase Oscar buzz - but apparently not at a single theater on the East Coast(?!).

[^4]: **Cyrano** was supposed to come out in January, but has been delayed to Feb 28. **The Worst Person in the World** and **Compartment No. 6** are international films that will get released closer to the Oscar ceremony, likely to capitalize on possible nominations buzz, as is typical each year. And **Writing With Fire** looks like it never got a theatrical release but will be released on VOD on 3/1/22. (It's a documentary about an Indian newspaper run by Dalit women using smartphones - I hadn't heard about it until making this list and now I really wish it were available to watch now!)

[^5]: **Passing** and **Mass**. They both came out for only a week or two at theaters far from me and were gone before I realized I should make the trip because they might be Oscar contenders. This has been a particular challenge with direct-to-Netflix films, of which there are more than ever this year. They usually only get an extremely limited release in select theaters for 1-2 weeks. I realize most people happily watch them on Netflix at home, but I strongly prefer the theatrical experience. At least I'd heard a LOT of buzz about  **The Power of the Dog** before it came out, so even though it was only playing at one theater in DC, I made a point of making the drive to see it. While I was there, I also saw two other Netflix films that I hadn't heard about before but were also only playing at this theater - **The Lost Daughter** and **The Hand of God**. I'm really glad I did, because they were great (especially the former) and never did come out anywhere else!

### Sort by category

Here's [Gold Derby's data](https://www.goldderby.com/odds/expert-odds/oscars-nominations-2022/) for each of the individual 23 Oscar categories. I downloaded the data on January 22.

As in past years, I omitted movie for which 0 experts predict a nomination or win; only movies that at least one expert thinks might be nominated are included.

Columns:

* **NOM** = The number of experts who believe a film will be *nominated* for that award.
* **WIN** = The number of experts who believe a film will *win* that award.
* **ODDS** = GoldDerby's calculated odds of a movie winning that award.
* **PTS** = Implied probability based on the odds. It's just `(Denominator) / (Numerator + Denominator)`. For example, a title with 4/1 odds is calculated as `(1) / (4 + 1)` = `(1 / 5)` = `20%`. In other words, the percentage chance of a movie winning that category.
