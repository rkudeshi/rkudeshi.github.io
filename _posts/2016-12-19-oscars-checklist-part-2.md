In my [last post](http://raviudeshi.com/16/12/oscars-checklist-2017), I made a list of the movies most likely to be nominated for Oscars, assigning them points based on Gold Derby's odds in each category. But I didn't know much about many of the films themselves, other than their title. So I went through and compiled Rotten Tomatoes & Metacritic scores, trailers, ratings, runtimes, actors, and more. Hope this helps some of you too!

(Note: I updated all movies to the latest Rotten Tomatoes/Metacritic scores, so they are slightly different from my previous post.)

* <span style="color:crimson">●</span> = No longer playing in theaters.
* <span style="color:gold">●</span> = Currently in theaters.
* <span style="color:limegreen">●</span> = Not yet released in theaters.

Most of the information in the tables below is from IMDB.[^runtimes] I've updated the release dates to when the movie goes out in wide release, if I knew it (this is surprisingly hard-to-find data!).[^releasedates] The plot synopses for each movie are from IMDB, because I noticed their synopses don't spoil major details revealed an hour into movies (why do other sites do this? It's maddening!). And finally, the critics consensuses are from Rotten Tomatoes and do a pretty good job of whetting your appetite without spoiling the films either.

[^runtimes]: At first, I was getting runtimes from Rotten Tomatoes. But weirdly enough, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes have slightly different runtimes for a bunch of movies! I wonder why that is? For consistency's sake, I've used IMDB's runtimes for everything.

[^releasedates]: One major annoyance now that I've been getting into more serious/"Oscar-bait" movies lately: they don't always have firm release dates, so you never know when they'll show up at your local theater! Unlike major blockbusters, which open everywhere on the same date, these small films often open in only about 100 theaters (for comparison's sake, Rogue One opened in [4,157](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/counts/), and then gradually expand if they do well. But some theaters drop these movies quickly, even as they expand to others! For example, I really wanted to see Moonlight when it debuted, but it was only playing at two theaters way out of the way for me. I had family in the hospital at the time, so by the time I had time to watch the movie, it was out of those theaters. I thought I was out of luck until it surprisingly showed up at my local theater weeks later. And even now, I've been driving to theaters all over the place to be able to watch films like The Edge of Seventeen or Nocturnal Animals (both so great!) because they're not at my local theater and I don't know if they ever will be.

SYNOPSIS: The story of Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple, whose challenge of their anti-miscegenation arrest for their marriage in Virginia led to a legal battle that would end at the US Supreme Court.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Loving takes an understated approach to telling a painful -- and still relevant -- real-life tale, with sensitive performances breathing additional life into a superlative historical drama.

SYNOPSIS: The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them draws on Harry Potter's rich mythology to deliver a spinoff that dazzles with franchise-building magic all its own.

SYNOPSIS: The story of Florence Foster Jenkins, a New York heiress who dreamed of becoming an opera singer, despite having a terrible singing voice.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Florence Foster Jenkins makes poignant, crowd-pleasing dramedy out of its stranger-than-fiction tale -- and does its subject justice with a reliably terrific turn from star Meryl Streep.

SYNOPSIS: The story of Chesley Sullenberger, an American pilot who became a hero after landing his damaged plane on the Hudson River in order to save the flight's passengers and crew.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: As comfortingly workmanlike as its protagonist, Sully makes solid use of typically superlative work from its star and director to deliver a quietly stirring tribute to an everyday hero.

SYNOPSIS: In Ancient Polynesia, when a terrible curse incurred by Maui reaches an impetuous Chieftain's daughter's island, she answers the Ocean's call to seek out the demigod to set things right.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: With a title character as three-dimensional as its lush animation and a story that adds fresh depth to Disney's time-tested formula, Moana is truly a family-friendly adventure for the ages.

SYNOPSIS: A dramatization of the April 2010 disaster when the offshore drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon, exploded and created the worst oil spill in U.S. history.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Deepwater Horizon makes effective use of its titular man-made disaster to deliver an uncommonly serious -- yet still suitably gripping -- action thriller.

SYNOPSIS: A fast-talking mercenary with a morbid sense of humor is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a quest for revenge.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Fast, funny, and gleefully profane, the fourth-wall-busting Deadpool subverts superhero film formula with wildly entertaining -- and decidedly non-family-friendly -- results.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk has noble goals, but lacks a strong enough screenplay to achieve them -- and its visual innovations are often merely distracting.

SYNOPSIS: In 1942, an intelligence officer in North Africa encounters a female French Resistance fighter on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. When they reunite in London, their relationship is tested by the pressures of war.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Allied has its moments, but doesn't quite achieve epic wartime romance status -- a disappointment made more profound by the dazzling talent assembled on either side of the camera.

SYNOPSIS: Lady Susan Vernon takes up temporary residence at her in-laws' estate and, while there, is determined to be a matchmaker for her daughter Frederica -- and herself too, naturally.

SYNOPSIS: As an Orc horde invades the planet Azeroth using a magic portal, a few human heroes and dissenting Orcs must attempt to stop the true evil behind this war.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Warcraft has visual thrills to spare, but they -- and director Duncan Jones' distinctive gifts -- are wasted on a sluggish and derivative adaptation of a bestselling game with little evident cinematic value.

SYNOPSIS: In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: As strange as it is thrillingly ambitious, The Lobster is definitely an acquired taste -- but for viewers with the fortitude to crack through Yorgos Lanthimos' offbeat sensibilities, it should prove a savory cinematic treat.

SYNOPSIS: A girl named Sophie encounters the Big Friendly Giant who, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kind-hearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because, unlike them, he refuses to eat children.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: The BFG minimizes the darker elements of Roald Dahl's classic in favor of a resolutely good-natured, visually stunning, and largely successful family-friendly adventure.

SYNOPSIS: The NSA's illegal surveillance techniques are leaked to the public by one of the agency's employees, Edward Snowden, in the form of thousands of classified documents distributed to the press.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Snowden boasts a thrilling fact-based tale and a solid lead performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, even if director Oliver Stone saps the story of some of its impact by playing it safe.

SYNOPSIS: The inspirational story of World Champion Boxer Vinny Pazienza who, after a near fatal car crash which left him not knowing if he'd ever walk again, made one of sport's most incredible comebacks.

CRITICS CONSENSUS: Bleed for This rises on the strength of Miles Teller's starring performance to deliver a solid fact-based boxing drama that takes a few genre clichés on the chin but keeps on coming.
