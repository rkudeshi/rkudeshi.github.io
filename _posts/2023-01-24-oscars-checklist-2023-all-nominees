title: "Oscars checklist 2023: All 54 films nominated and where to stream them"
---

As someone who participates in the "Oscars Death Race" - trying to watch every movie nominated at the Oscars in every category! - I like to put together a list of all the nominated films, sorted by their "highest" nominated category.

Here is the list of all 54 films nominated for this year's Oscars, with links for where to stream them. I hope you use this and watch some of these *great* films!

Personally, this has been a very stressful and busy year at work, so I've managed to watch fewer of the nominated films than usual. As of today, here's where I stand on the 54 total films:
- **20 feature films already seen.** Looks like I managed to see all of these in theaters!
- **19 feature films not seen yet.** These are mostly documentary and international films, some of which haven't been released in theaters or VOD yet. Unfortunately, it also includes 7 movies that were in theaters in my area, but I just missed them (or haven't had a chance to see them yet.)
- **15 short films.** Some theaters will play these a week or two before the ceremony, so I like to wait to watch them until then.

The big ceremony is on March 12, 2022 - looks like I've got some work to do if I want to watch everything before then!

### The big list
