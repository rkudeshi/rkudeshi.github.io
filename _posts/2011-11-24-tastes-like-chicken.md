I once read an article about the things that taste most like chicken.[^1] First was chicken.

But second was Tofurky.

I don't know if that's true or not. What I do know is that Tofurky puts quotidian vegetarian fare to shame. And it keeps getting better [every year](http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1993883,00.html).

Try one sometime. You might—nay, will—be pleasantly surprised.

PS. Some Black Friday advice from a battle-hardened veteran: skip the stores, shop online.
