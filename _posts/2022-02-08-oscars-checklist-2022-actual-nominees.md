title: "Oscars checklist 2022: The actual nominees (53 films!)"
---

As an avid Oscars Death Racer (trying to watch all movies nominated in all categories), I put together the list of all 53 films nominated for an Oscar this year. Instead of just sorting by number of nominations, I like to group them by their “highest” nominated category, which I find a more useful way of organizing the list.

In a new addition this year, I've also added streaming links for every film, if I could find them on JustWatch. I prefer to watch everything in theaters, but hopefully this helps some of the rest of you watch these great films!

As of today, here's where I stand on the 53 total films:
- **30 feature films already seen.** I saw 27 of these in theaters and 3 at home.
- **8 feature films not seen yet.** These are mostly documentary and international films, some of which haven't been released in theaters or VOD yet.
- **15 short films.** I put off watching these until a week or two before the ceremony, when they're released in theaters. (If you've never seen a series of short films in a theater, it's a great experience!)

The big ceremony is on March 27, 2022 - looks like I've got plenty of time to finish the Oscars Death Race again this year!
