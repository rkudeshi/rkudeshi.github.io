I've always been curious about when presidential candidates drop out of the race, especially relative to important election dates. Some candidates drop out after underperforming in a primary. Others call it quits after having problems raising money following a bad debate performance. Or, in 2012 for example, Tim Pawlenty dropped out after a poor showing at the Iowa Straw Poll.

I looked around for a good, simple calendar with this information, but didn't find one. So I made my own!

First, I grouped important events by type (because it was a lot easier to skim and read). But, at the bottom of the post, I also merged them all into one big completely chronological & <span style="color:red">color</span><span style="color:green">-</span><span style="color:blue">coded</span> list. If you find any missing/mistaken data, let me know!

#### <a name="entrances"></a>Notable entrance dates

* 2015-03-23: ENTER - Ted Cruz is 1st Republican to officially enter race
* 2015-04-12: ENTER - Hillary Clinton is 1st Democrat to officially enter race
* 2015-07-30: ENTER - Jim Gilmore is 17th & final Republican to officially enter race
* 2015-09-06: ENTER - Lawrence Lessig is 6th & final Democrat to officially enter race

*I didn't include all the candidates because these dates are mostly meaningless. Serious candidates form a Presidential Exploratory Committee 3-6 months before officially entering the race. As I understand it, these committees used to actually be "exploratory" - candidates used this time to test the waters and figure out if they should seriously run or not. But nowadays, every candidate who creates a committee is almost certainly running and uses the exploratory period to instead raise unlimited money for their Super PAC...which they can legally do because they haven't "officially" declared they're running for President. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯*
