title: "Oscars checklist 2019: The actual nominees (52 movies!)"
---

Now that we know all the nominations, it's time to put together the list of all movies. Instead of just sorting by number of nominations, I like to group them by their "highest" nominated category. This helps me prioritize as I'm trying to complete the Oscars Death Race (watching all movies in all categories!) each year.

If it's helpful, I've also made a Letterboxd list of these movies:

- [All 2019 Oscar nominees in all categories (with shorts - 52 films)](https://letterboxd.com/rkudeshi/list/all-2019-oscar-nominees-in-all-categories-1/)
- [All 2019 Oscar nominees in all categories (no shorts - 37 films)](https://letterboxd.com/rkudeshi/list/all-2019-oscar-nominees-in-all-categories/)
