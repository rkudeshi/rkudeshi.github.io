<p>Steve Jobs passed away today. He will be remembered for revolutionizing at least four industries: music (iPod, iTunes Music Store), movies (Pixar), mobile phones (iPhone) and, of course, computers (Macintosh, iPad).</p>
<p>His contributions to the world have made my life immeasurably better. He continually pushed the envelope and the technology industry is demonstrably better for it.</p>
<p>Most people will remember him tonight for the products he had a hand in creating. I&#8217;d like to take a step back and look at the consummate showman and prescient visionary.</p>
<p>Because he generally shunned interviews and public appearances, there is not much public footage available of Jobs. In fact, I only know of three places that he had publicly spoken: Apple keynotes, the D: All Things Digital conference, and at Stanford&#8217;s 2005 commencement.</p>
<h3 id="keynotes">Keynotes</h3>
<p>Most people only saw Jobs at Apple&#8217;s product launches. His ability to command the room and stage is legion.</p>
<p>While he had many great moments, the beginning of the iPhone keynote at Macworld in 2007 was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASkis57blsc">his most masterful</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dconference">D Conference</h3>
<p>As <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20111005/the-steve-jobs-i-knew/">Walt Mossberg noted tonight</a>, Steve was most comfortable on stage, with a script. That is what makes his unscripted interviews at the D: All Things Digital conferences all the more compelling.</p>
<p>I watched these videos for the first time only a couple years ago. I was blown away by how eerily accurate Steve&#8217;s predictions were about where the technology industry would be today.</p>

<h3 id="stanfordcommencementaddress">Stanford Commencement Address</h3>
<p>Perhaps Jobs&#8217; most famous public appearance, however, is his 2005 Stanford commencement address. It is, as far as I know, the only time he has delved into his personal life at some length.</p>
<p>He tells three stories from his life: one about connecting the dots, another about love and loss, and the last about death. They are simple, amusing, insightful, morbid, and hopeful.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_ptbiPoXM&feature=player_detailpage#t=450s">the video (speech starts at 7:30)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Remembering that I&#8217;ll be dead soon is the most important tool I&#8217;ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.&#8221;<br />
